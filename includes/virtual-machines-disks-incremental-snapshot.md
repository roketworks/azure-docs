# Creating an incremental snapshot (preview) for managed disks

Incremental snapshots (preview) are point in time backups for managed disks that, when taken, consist only of all the changes since the last snapshot. When you attempt to download or otherwise use an incremental snapshot, the full VHD is used. This new capability for managed disk snapshots can potentially allow them to be more cost effective, since you are no longer required to store the entire disk with each individual snapshot, unless you choose to. Just like regular snapshots, incremental snapshots can be used to create a full managed disk or, to make a regular snapshot.

There are a few differences between an incremental snapshot and a regular snapshot. Incremental snapshots will always use standard HDDs storage, irrespective of the storage type of the disk, whereas regular snapshots can use premium SSDs. If you are using regular snapshots on Premium Storage to scale up VM deployments, we recommend you to use custom images on standard storage in the [Shared Image Gallery](../articles/virtual-machines/linux/shared-image-galleries.md). It will help you to achieve a more massive scale with lower cost. Additionally, incremental snapshots potentially offer better reliability with [zone-redundant storage](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-zrs.md) (ZRS). If ZRS is available in the selected region, an incremental snapshot will use ZRS automatically. If ZRS is not available in the region, then the snapshot will default to [locally-redundant storage](../articles/storage/common/storage-redundancy-lrs.md) (LRS). You can override this behavior and select one manually but, we do not recommend that.

Incremental snapshots also offer a differential capability, which is uniquely available to managed disks. They enable you to get the changes between two incremental snapshots of the same managed disks, down to the block level. You can use this capability to reduce your data footprint when copying snapshots across regions.

If you haven't yet signed up for the preview and you'd like to start using incremental snapshots, please email us at AzureDisks@microsoft.com to get access to the public preview.

## Restrictions

- Incremental snapshots currently cannot be created after you've changed the size of a disk.
- Incremental snapshots currently cannot be moved between subscriptions.
- You can currently only generate SAS URIs of up to five snapshots of a particular snapshot family at any given time.
- You cannot create an incremental snapshot for a particular disk outside of that disk's subscription.
- Up to seven incremental snapshots per disk can be created every five minutes.
- A total of 200 incremental snapshots can be created for a single disk.

## PowerShell

You can use Azure PowerShell to create an incremental snapshot. You can install the latest version of PowerShell locally. You will need the latest version of Azure PowerShell, the following command will either install it or update your existing installation to latest:

```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
```

Once that is installed, login to your PowerShell session with `az login`.

Replace `<yourDiskNameHere>`, `<yourResourceGroupNameHere>`, and `<yourDesiredSnapShotNameHere>` with your values, then you can use the following script to create an incremental snapshot:

```PowerShell
# Get the disk that you need to backup by creating an incremental snapshot
$yourDisk = Get-AzDisk -DiskName <yourDiskNameHere> -ResourceGroupName <yourResourceGroupNameHere>

# Create an incremental snapshot by setting:
# 1. Incremental property
# 2. SourceUri property with the value of the Id property of the disk
$snapshotConfig=New-AzSnapshotConfig -SourceUri $yourDisk.Id -Location $yourDisk.Location -CreateOption Copy -Incremental 
New-AzSnapshot -ResourceGroupName <yourResourceGroupNameHere> -SnapshotName <yourDesiredSnapshotNameHere> -Snapshot $snapshotConfig 

# You can identify incremental snapshots of the same disk by using the SourceResourceId and SourceUniqueId properties of snapshots. 
# SourceResourceId is the Azure Resource Manager resource ID of the parent disk. 
# SourceUniqueId is the value inherited from the UniqueId property of the disk. If you delete a disk and then create a disk with the same name, the value of the UniqueId property will change. 
# Following script shows how to get all the incremental snapshots in a resource group of same disk
$snapshots = Get-AzSnapshot -ResourceGroupName <yourResourceGroupNameHere>

$incrementalSnapshots = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
foreach ($snapshot in $snapshots)
{
    
    if($snapshot.Incremental -and $snapshot.CreationData.SourceResourceId -eq $yourDisk.Id -and $snapshot.CreationData.SourceUniqueId -eq $yourDisk.UniqueId){

        $incrementalSnapshots.Add($snapshot)
    }
}

$incrementalSnapshots
```

## Resource Manager template

You can also use Azure Resource Manager templates to create an incremental snapshot. You'll need to make sure the apiVersion is set to **2019-03-01** and that the incremental property is also set to true. The following snippet is an example of how to create an incremental snapshot with Resource Manager templates:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
  "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "parameters": {
    "diskName": {
      "type": "string",
      "defaultValue": "contosodisk1"
    },
  "diskResourceId": {
    "defaultValue": "<your_managed_disk_resource_ID>",
    "type": "String"
  }
  }, 
  "resources": [
  {
    "type": "Microsoft.Compute/snapshots",
    "name": "[concat( parameters('diskName'),'_snapshot1')]",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "apiVersion": "2019-03-01",
    "properties": {
      "creationData": {
        "createOption": "Copy",
        "sourceResourceId": "[parameters('diskResourceId')]"
      },
      "incremental": true
    }
  }
  ]
}
```

## CLI

You can create an incremental snapshot with the Azure CLI using [az snapshot create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/snapshot?view=azure-cli-latest#az-snapshot-create). An example command would look like the following:

```bash
az snapshot create -g <exampleResourceGroup> \
-n <exampleSnapshotName> \
-l <exampleLocation> \
--source <exampleVMId> \
--incremental
```

You can also identify what snapshots are incremental snapshots in the CLI with by using the `--query` parameter on [az snapshot show](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/snapshot?view=azure-cli-latest#az-snapshot-show). You can use that parameter to directly query the **SourceResourceId** and **SourceUniqueId** properties of snapshots. SourceResourceId is the Azure Resource Manager resource ID of the parent disk. **SourceUniqueId** is the value inherited from the **UniqueId** property of the disk. If you delete a disk and then create a disk with the same name, the value of the **UniqueId** property will change.

Examples of either queries would look like the following:

```bash
az snapshot show -g <exampleResourceGroup> \
-n <yourSnapShotName> \
--query [creationData.sourceResourceId] -o tsv

az snapshot show -g <exampleResourceGroup> \
-n <yourSnapShotName> \
--query [creationData.sourceUniqueId] -o tsv
```
